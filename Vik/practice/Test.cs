
// Question:
// Minimum operations required to return to main folder
// John is working on a complex project. The main project directory 
// has many nested directories. I.e directory inside a directory.Duw to the complexity
// has to change the directory every time he has to work on a different modules.
// Sometimes he does not remember in which directory he is working and how
// to go back to the main directory.-root directory

// Write a program which would find the minimum steps required to go 
// back to the main directory from the current directory given the sequence of
// operations performed by join after entering the root directory.
// Jon can perform the following operations:
// 1."../": Moves to the parent folder of the current folder. 
// (If current folder is the main it stays in the same folder)
// 2."./":Remains in the same folder.
// 3."F/": Moves to the child folder named F.

// Input 1- 6
// Input 2- arr[] = {"F1/","F2/","./","F3/","../","F31/"}
// Output - 3
